# As a data scientist working on this project, my responsibilities include:

Collecting and processing data: Collect data on past Falcon 9 launches, including information on the launch date, mission name, launch site, launch outcome, and first stage landing outcome. You will also need to process the data to make it usable for machine learning models.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. Use visualizations and statistical techniques to gain insights into the data and determine which features are most important for predicting the first stage landing outcome.

Feature engineering: Based on the insights gained from EDA, engineer new features or transform existing features to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model selection and training: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or a decision tree, and train it on the processed data. Use appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model and tune its parameters to improve its accuracy.

Deployment: Once the model has been trained and validated, deploy it to make predictions on new data. create a user interface that allows the user to input data on a future Falcon 9 launch and get a prediction on the first stage landing outcome.

Reporting: create a report summarizing your findings, including the accuracy of the model and the most important features for predicting the first stage landing outcome. Also provide recommendations for how an alternate company can use this information to bid competitively against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
