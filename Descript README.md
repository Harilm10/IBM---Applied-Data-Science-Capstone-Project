SpaceY is a recently established player in the commercial rocket launch industry, aiming to compete with SpaceX by bidding against them for launch contracts.
SpaceX advertises launch services starting at $67 million, which includes reserving fuel for reusing the first stage rocket booster.
According to public statements from SpaceX, the cost of building a first stage Falcon 9 rocket booster is estimated to be over $15 million, not including R&D expenses or profit margin.
The report shows that by considering mission parameters like payload mass and desired orbit, the models were able to predict the first stage rocket booster landing with an accuracy level of 83.3%.
Using first stage landing predictions as a cost proxy for launches, SpaceY can make more informed bids against SpaceX.
